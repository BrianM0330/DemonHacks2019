# SmartPark

Have you ever planned a trip to the city, and gone through all of the parking garage's exorbitant prices? Unfortunately, you'll likely have to cough up double or triple the price of what street parking costs because of how difficult it is to get an accurate **and** timely probability of getting parking downtown. SmartPark was developed to help commuters around the country with one of the most exhausting issues - street parking. SmartPark is a powerful web application powered by an incredibly efficient Neural Network built with Tensorflow which is fed into a Flask implementation. SmartPark aims to provide *regular* users with access to open street parking spots, and provide them with all the information they need to make the commute painless. 

## What's next?
We plan to incorporate as much cameras around the city as possible to get frequent, reliable and accurate data. Aside from that, in the future we plan to incorporate technology that will help users find optimal routes to maximize the probability of finding a parking spot. On top of that, we also plan on implementing an algorithm that will suggest alternative routes using a combination of transportation methods (driving, biking, scootering) in scenarios where parking is scarce and/or traffic is bad.
